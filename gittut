forking and branching

fork the repo (click button fork)
clone the fork repo, copy the url(click button clone or download)
on your working machine type: git clone <repourl>
//you now have a copy of the forked repo on your machine

go to the dir of your repo
//to create a new branch
git branch <branch1>
//to show all branch
git branch 
//to switch branch
git checkout <branch1>
//you can now work on your <branch1>
//you can add a file
vim sample.file
//to show status, it will show a new file 
git status
//to add this file
git add sample.file
//to commit it on your branch1
git commit -m "message"
//you have now created a file on your branch, to merge it to the master
//got back to the master branch
git checkout master
//merge the branch1 to the master
git merge branch1
//to check if the file in branch1 has been added in master, look for the file
ls
//if satisfied, push the master to the fork repo
git push <repourl> master
//check on the git console if the sample.file has been added



-------set alias on repo----------------------
//check if your remote repo has been set
//if your repo has been clone, it will auto set your repo to alias the <repourl
git remote -v
//if there is a result like below, your remote has been set up
origin <repourl> (fetch)
origin <repourl> (push)
//you can push directly
git push origin master



git remote add upstream <repourl>
//to set an alias origin as the repo url

//now instead of 
git push <repourl> master
//we use, 
git push upstream master

-------make sure your local repo is up to date--------------------------
git pull origin master

---push your branch to remote repo for review-------------------------
//git push <repourl> <branch>
git push origin branch1
//see console, look for pull request
